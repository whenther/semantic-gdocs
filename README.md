# Semantic GDocs

Convert exported Google Docs HTML to semantic HTML

Google Docs can export a document as HTML. But if you want to import that HTML
somewhere else, you'll have problems. This cleans up the Google Docs export
(and will probably work on similar HTML), and gives you clean, semantic HTML
that you can import into a rich text editor.

In Google Docs, go to File > Download As > Webpage, open the HTML in a text editor, 
and copy the whole thing. Make sure to get everything, especailly the head tag! 
Then paste it all in the <strong>Import</strong> box, and copy out clean HTML 
from the <strong>Semantic</strong> box. That's all there is to it! Note that you
may see some funny characters - but it should render fine.
